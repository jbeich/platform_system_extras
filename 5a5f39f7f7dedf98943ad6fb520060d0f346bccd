      "message": "Thank you for debugging this issue. It\u0027s unfortunate that `android::base::SetProperty` is flaky. Perhaps this needs to get fixed inside `SetProperty`?\n\nI guess this issue probably also applies to the `kcmdline.binder` property above. Maybe `UpdateProps` as a whole should be retried when either `SetProperty` call fails?\n\nWhat do you think? At the very least, there should be a comment about why we\u0027re retrying.",
